Burro is a platform for small-scale self-driving cars. It was inspired by [Donkey](http://donkeycar.com).


### Requirements

Using Burro you can build either a RC-style Ackermann steering car, or a Differential steering car (like a three-wheel robot).
Depending on your hardware Burro will automatically select and setup the right kind of vehicle each time you run it. Thus you may share the same SD card among different vehicles without any changes.

#### Hardware

##### RC-Style Ackermann Steering car
- 1/10 or 1/16 RC car with PWM connections for throttle and steering
- Raspberry Pi 2 or 3
- An SD card with at least 16Gb capacity
- RaspiCam, Fisheye model (something like [this](http://www.ebay.com/itm/191723967593))
- [NAVIO2](https://emlid.com/navio/) HAT
- Either a Logitech F710 Gamepad or a PPM or SBUS-compatible RC receiver

##### Differential Steering car
- Differential steering robot kit with two motors
- Raspberry Pi 2 or 3
- An SD card with at least 16Gb capacity
- RaspiCam, Fisheye model (something like [this](http://www.ebay.com/itm/191723967593))
- [Adafruit Motor HAT](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2348)
- A Logitech F710 Gamepad

You could also use Burro with a [RasPiRobot Board V3](https://www.monkmakes.com/rrb3/) to make a differential steering car, but this requires to edit code and is untested.

#### Software

Burro runs on Raspbian. We recommend the latest Raspbian image from the folks at EMLID. [Here are the instructions](https://docs.emlid.com/navio2/common/ardupilot/configuring-raspberry-pi/) to get it installed and running on an SD card. You will need to [expand your filesystem](http://elinux.org/RPi_raspi-config#expand_rootfs_-_Expand_root_partition_to_fill_SD_card).

If you don;t use NAVIO2 you can also use a [vanilla Raspbian image](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/). If you do so, you'll need to [enable Camera and I2C](https://github.com/yconst/burro/wiki/Enable-Camera-and-I2C-in-Raspberry-Pi).


### Installation

Burro includes an installation script that handles installing necessary libraries, setting up the Python virtualenv and configuring submodules. To download and run:

    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yconst/burro/master/install-burro.sh
    chmod +x install-burro.sh
    ./install-burro.sh

If you would like you can take a look [here](https://github.com/yconst/burro/wiki/Installed-Packages-and-Libraries) to find out more about the libraries and packages that the script is installing.

### Running

Connect up a Logitech F710 gamepad to the RPi USB port or a RC receiver to the NAVIO2 receiver pins.
`cd` where your `install-burro.sh` script that you downloaded earlier is, and:

    cd burro/burro
    ./start.sh

Visit your Raspberry local network address to bring up the web interface. If you've chosen the EMLID image, it will be `http://navio.local`. Otherwise it will be `http://raspberry.local`.

Choose your driving method (by default it is either gamepad or RC, based on availability). Choose if you want to save images while moving (for training models); the background color of the steering indicator will change to green to indicate standby, red once recording.


### Next Steps

Please take a look at the [Burro Wiki](https://github.com/yconst/burro/wiki) for more information, including [help on configuring](https://github.com/yconst/burro/wiki/Configuring) and [controlling your car](https://github.com/yconst/burro/wiki/Control-a-Burro-car-using-the-F710-Gamepad).

Regular news and examples are posted in the [Unmanned Build](http://unmannedbuild.yconst.com) blog.
